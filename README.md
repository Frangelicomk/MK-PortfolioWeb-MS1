+ ### Design

  + Colour Scheme

     + I used thre colours for the whole project Xibetic #0F1020 for the background, the Alabaster #E0E2DB for
     the text and Antique Brass #D09076 for the accent colours. There reason I picked the three colours is that I had in
     mind that my users might be color blinds and these three colours mats together and provide good contrast that covers
     all types of color blindness such as Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, Achromatopsia, Protanomaly etc. As I work
     full time in the health sector I took in consideration people with epilepsy and I wanted all the text to be readable 
     and the colors and brightness will not affect their condition as a brighter colours might do. For the same reason I did not
     make my page colourful.

  + Typography 

     + The Doris font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. For the Headings and some Important notes the Alegraya font has been used with serif as a fallback. I picked these two cause they read nice in all devices and I have done a big research before picking these fonts.
  
  + Imagery 
     
     + I have used two photos relevant to my two differnt qualifications and placed them in the landing page. Also the images refer straight without reading any text to programming and medical/nursing. I used images around the website which I personally took
     and adjusted in photoshop for the needs of the website. Two of the photos I had to copy from Unsplash which I will link to the 
     credits section.

+ ### Wireframes
  
   + I removed the embed images as they were covering the whole markdown and users has to scroll long way through, I have done a research and it is rather complicated to make a download function on the markdown as github stops the download function.
   + Please if you want to view the wireframes navigate on my github repository on the project and find the folder assets, click on that folder and find the folder with a name wireframes, click on that folder to view the the wireframes or click [here!](https://github.com/Frangelicomk/MK-PortfolioWeb-MS1/tree/master/assets/wireframes)

+ Tested by friends from facebook and colleagues in differnt divices

  + I have posted the link of the deployed website on my facebook page and asked from friends and family to provide a feedback
  since I have started the project. The feedback was mostly positive about how easy is to read the text even on small devices
  and they can also read the text with dimmed lights without any issues. Also the navigation was easy and understandable. Some got worried about the Lorem text but I re-assured them that it is only temporary as they thought the text would not show on their devices. A comment has been made regarding some of the links not working at times as I have not had them enabled but this issue has no been resolved and everything works smoothly. I have to get better photos and find a way to present photos better as users
  found the photos on the about me page and the blog page are boring. This is something I plan to work better on a future update as I wanted to adjust the photos on my own on photoshop but I run out of time.

+ Feedback
  
  + I used Type-form for the most feedbacks and also slack community. The feedback was again possitive and there was still some queries recarding Lorem text which I will replace before submission of the project. Users who gave feedback have used mostly their phones and laptops I havent received any feedback yet from larger screens or tablets. The site seems to behave appropriately in all browswers including Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE, and Chrome. Slack community mentioned that there was an margin error on the landing page images on small devices which i have now resolved. Looking forward for more feedback to arrive so I can improve the website.

### Further Testing
+ The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Safari browsers.
+ The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S8, Samsung S20 Ultra and iPhoneX.
+ A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly. 
+ Friends, Colleagues from work and family members were asked to review the site and documentation <br>to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
+ [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) used for feedback , I had the basic plan so i will try to attach it on my websites contact form.
+ I personally have access in 27" 4K Monitor, a 17" Laptop, Android phone which I constatly used for testing.
+ I have used Chrome Developer Tools as Opera Dev Tools to constantly check the website responsivness.
+ As I dont want more images on the markdown please find the testing screenshots on the testing folder. This can be achieved if you navigate on my github page then go to MK-PORTFOLIOWEB-MS1 project there you will find a folder named assets
if you click on there you will see a subfolder testing. If you right click on that folder you will see the images I have uploaded.
Alternatively you can click [here](https://github.com/Frangelicomk/MK-PortfolioWeb-MS1/tree/master/assets/images) to see the folder on my github straight away.

### Difficulties Encountered & Bugs
+ Most difficult part is the design and animation of the Hero Image on Hover effect with lighting correctly, as i want<br> 
done by using only pure CSS - This wasnt solved yet as it was difficult to be managed with CSS at my current level but in the future i will work more on the animation part.
+ Read More does not work as intended looking for a solution regarding this.
+ 29.04.2021: I have solved the issue with read more buttons, I have found the solution in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710089/how-do-i-make-an-html-link-look-like-a-button)
+ 02.05.2021: I had issues with the responsivness of the website, this have been solved when I found out that I was
    using flex properties on top of the classes I used from Bootstrap and it was cause a big issue.
+ 07.05.2021: Issue on small devices on hero images padding. I have used a media Query to remove the .row.gutter on small devices as it was causing problems with my contact form. I have resolved this issue after i have taken off the media query and
    adding no gutter class from bootstrap to the .row i wanted to have effect and also added a padding on the same row and the contact form is now working as it should be on all device sizes.
+ 07.05.2021: My first commits when i was designing my website were differnt than the submission purely because I had an idea about my landing page which I lacked the knowledge to bring it to life. This will be updated in the futre when I get to understand Java script. I have done a big research and lost valuable time trying to do something I couldnt understand when I first started the project but I was so keen to try it out.
+ Overall I havent encounter bugs or issues that couldnt be solved in a timely manner.
