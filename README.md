### Testing User Stories

### Further Testing
+ The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Safari browsers.
+ The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S8, Samsung S20 Ultra and iPhoneX.

+ [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) used for feedback , I had the basic plan so i will try to attach it on my websites contact form.

### Difficulties Encountered & Bugs
+ Most difficult part is the design and animation of the Hero Image on Hover effect with lighting correctly, as i want<br> 
done by using only pure CSS - This wasnt solved yet as it was difficult to be managed with CSS at my current level but in the future i will work
more on the animation part.
+ Read More does not work as intended looking for a solution regarding this.
    - 29.04.2021: I have solved the issue with read more buttons, I have found the solution in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710089/how-do-i-make-an-html-link-look-like-a-button)
